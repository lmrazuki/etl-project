## Team
- Louis Razuki
- Christy Wang
- Matthew Belevski

## Project Aim
Compile a database of Movies & TV shows that are currently on popular streaming platforms. These will be:
- Netflix
- Disney+
- Hulu

## Use cases
Weâ€™ve identified a number of possible use cases that have informed the datapoints we will collect. Some of these include:
- Which streaming platform has the most acclaimed collection?
- Which streaming platform has the most content?
- Which streaming platform has the highest rated content?


## Our approach:
We have separated the tasks into three components:

- **Christy** will use the base CSVs to create the foundational tables for both Movies and TV Shows. She will also create the schema in PGAdmin for us to load in the data. Christy will then join the API data generated by Matt and Louis.

- **Matt** will use the API to generate information for Movies. 

- **Louis** will use the API to generate information for TV Shows. 

We will use Python for the initial transformation, cleaning the data appropriately. We will join the dataframes using Pandas, with a primary key created from the Title & Year. Once we have our two summary tables, they will be loaded into a relational database using PGAdmin.
